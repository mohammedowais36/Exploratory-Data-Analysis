# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a way to better understand the data which helps in further Data preprocessing. This project involves in generating summary statistics for numerical data in the Haberman dataset and creating various graphical plots/representations to understand the data better. In this project data visualization has been the key, making the exploratory data analysis process streamline and easily analyzing data using wonderful plots and charts. The various plots used in this project are:
Distplot
Boxplot
Violinplot
Scatterplot
Pairplot
